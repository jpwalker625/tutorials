## Introduction

 Here is an example of my really cool markdown file using `pretty doc` elements

To start, I'm using:

```output:
      prettydoc::html_pretty:
        toc: yes
        theme: tactile
        highlight: github
```

Other options for themes include: `archtiect, cayman, hpstr, and leonids`
The other possible highlight option is: `vignette`

For more info, check out this site:

`html_pretty` in the [**prettydoc**](http://github.com/yixuan/prettydoc/)
package is a new output format for creating HTML document from R Markdown files.
`html_pretty` is more lightweight compared to `html_document`, and is more
stylish than `html_vignette` when creating package vignettes.
