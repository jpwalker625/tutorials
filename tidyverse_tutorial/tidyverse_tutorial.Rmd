Notes:: add the principles of a tidy data frame
WTF is a tibble?
Add helpful links and cheatsheets

```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```


First off, install the tidyverse:

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

Next, load it:

```{r load tidyverse, warning = FALSE, message=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

It is important to note that only the **core** packages are loaded.  Other tidyverse packages need to be loaded explicitly.  We can see all packages that are part of the tidyverse with the following code:

```{r all tidverse packages}
tidyverse_packages(include_self = TRUE)
```

So where should we start?

One of the key concepts in R for Data Science is understanding the model used to approach a data science project.  

We can think about this model more broadly to fit the scope of any problem we have or data we seek to analyze:

So then, let's dive into the packages one by one as we follow along the model. But first, a few important things to know.

**What the hell is a tibble?**



# Import {.tabset .tabset-pills}

In order to work with your data in R, you have to import it!


## readr

* Functions tend to be faster (~10x)
* readr functions produce *tibbles* and don't convert character vectors to factors
* reproducible: some base R functions inherit behavior from your OS and environment variables and may not work if you share with others

Useful for reading and writing csv, tsv, tables, lines(of a file or string).

```{r readr}

write_csv(x = mtcars, path = "mtcars_data.csv") # writes to current working directory unless otherwise specified in the path argument

read_csv(file = "mtcars_data.csv", col_names = TRUE)
```

---

## readxl

* Must be loaded explicitly  
* Useful for .xls & .xlsx files  

---

## jsonlite

* for pasing json files
* `tidyjson` contains jsonlite functionality and is a useful package that uses 'tidy' principles for turning json data into useful tables.

## other types of data

**Haven** for SPSS, Stata and SAS files  
**xml2** for parsing xml  
**rvest** for web scraping

# Tidy & Transform {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The bread and butter of data analysis involves tidying and transformation, often called data 'wrangling'.

At the heart of R coding using tidy principles is the piping function **`%>%`**. This useful tools allows you to string together operations in an intuitive way. The piping operator was born from the magrittr package, self described in the vignette as:

> The magrittr (to be pronounced with a sophisticated french accent) is a package with two aims: to decrease development time and to improve readability and maintainability of code. Or even shortr: to make your code smokin' (puff puff)!

The pipe operator, along with many tidyverse functions uses Non-Standard Evaluation (NSE). This concept is essential to the core of R programming. All you need to know about it for now is that it dramatically reduces the amount of typing. 

For more on NSE: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/nse.html



## Syntax

The following functions are basic, but essential for wrangling data.


`tbl_df` makes it easier to take a look at a data frame. R displays only the info. that fits on the screen

`glimpse` gives an information dense summary of the data (analagous to `str()`).

`View` (with a capital V) allows you to view the data in a separate tab as a spreadsheet or excel like format  

```{r basics}
# tbl_df cleans it up
tbl_df(mtcars)

# densely summarizes the data
glimpse(mtcars)
```

## Reshaping Data {.tabset .tabset-pills}

`gather()` & `spread()` allow you to convert a data frame from wide to tall and vice-versa using a system of key-value pairing.

In order for spread to work, each row must have a unique identifier (such as a row index). Otherwise, R won't know how to make proper key-value pair combos in relation to the rest of the variables in your data set.

For the following examples:
`devtools::install_github("garrettgman/DSR")`

```{r load DSR}
# data sets containing WHO documented cases of TB
library(DSR)
```
---

### gather
```{r gather examples}
# cases of TB for 3 countries occurring in 2 separate years 
tbl_df(DSR::table4)

gather(data = table4, key = year, value = cases, columns = 2:3) %>%
  arrange(country)

# population of 3 countries recorded in 2 separate years
tbl_df(table5)

table5 %>% 
  gather(key = year, value = population, -country) %>%
  arrange(desc(population))
```

### spread
```{r spread examples}
#population of 219 countries from 1995-2013
glimpse(population)

spread(data = population, key = year, value = population)
```

Here's an example where spread won't work

```{r spread failure, error=TRUE}
scores <- data_frame(id = c(1:6), 
                     group_id = c(1211, 1311, 2634, 1311, 1211, 2634), 
                     exam_1 = c(67, 77, 45, 92, 83, 70),
                     exam_2 = c(85, 76, 69, 94, 88, 80),
                     exam_3 = c(91, 94, 88, 79, 97, 100))

gathered_scores <- scores %>% gather(exam, score, exam_1:exam_3)

tbl_df(gathered_scores)

gathered_scores %>%
  select(-id) %>%
  spread(key = exam, value = score) %>%
  print()
```
